Evaluation of top 3 ideas 

Pokedex
mobile: glorified website using a public API
story: People would default to existing options, value is having pokedex on your phone. 
market: Pokemon is the larger grossing franchise, so big playerbase. 
habit: People who want to check out Pokemon.
Scope: Only Pokemon added to API can be indexed. can be slow to show newer Pokemon

restaurant finder
mobile: uses maps and locations to find the best place to eat
story: Users would be able to find good places to eat easier
market: The market isn't that unique as most maps apps have a restaurant finder included
habit: finding a place to eat would be the only reason to use this app
scope: may be challenging to implement location and maps in order to find the location of places to eat

Pronouncer
mobile: Uses iOS TTS only on iOS, audio, real-time, input
Story: IOS has TTS built in, 
market: People who learn English as a 2nd language,
habit: People want to fact-check words before they use them.
