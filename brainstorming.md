# Evaluation of top 3 ideas 

### Pokedex
* Mobile: glorified website using a public API
* Story: People would default to existing options, value is having pokedex on your phone. 
* Market: Pokemon is the larger grossing franchise, so big player base. 
* Habit: People who want to check out Pokemon.
* Scope: Only Pokemon added to API can be indexed. can be slow to show newer Pokemon

### Restaurant Finder
* Mobile: uses maps and locations to find the best place to eat
* Story: Users would be able to find good places to eat more easily
* Market: The market isn't that unique as most maps apps have a restaurant finder included
* Habit: finding a place to eat would be the only reason to use this app
* Scope: may be challenging to implement location and maps in order to find the location of places to eat

### Pronouncer
* Mobile: Uses iOS TTS only on iOS, audio, real-time, input
* Story: IOS has TTS built in, 
* Market: People who learn English as a 2nd language,
* Habit: People want to fact-check words before they use them.
